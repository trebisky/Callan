This description will be attached to my bad
Micro Memory MM-8086D card.
It has the following issues:

1) It cost me at least a month of frustration and confusion.

And in chronological order of discovery

2) When jumpered to start at address 0, it does not work !?
  I forget the details of the failure.

3) I wrote a RAM diagnostic and it finds many bad patches in
  a fairly regular pattern.  I had hoped to just use good
  areas, but that leads to 4 and 5

4) A bypass capacitor on the unused 12 volt rail was shorted
  which gives the power supply grief and I misdiagnosed as
  a power supply problem.  This capacitor was found and removed.

5) discovered 4-15-2022, When the HD controller tries to do DMA
  writes, the card locks up the multibus causing total chaos.
  DMA reads seem to work fine (and the CPU can do writes).

After discovering (5) I swapped my other 64K card into the Callan,
and it seems to work perfectly.  This card is almost certainly
not worth the trouble to troubleshoot and repair
