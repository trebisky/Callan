My first code for the Callan Hard Drive controller.

This has mostly been a month long miserable troubleshooting
experience involving bad power supplies and above all a
faulty multibus memory board.

The problem was solved in a day using my Openbench Logic Sniffer.
There are detailed notes in the comments, especially in hd.c

I am going to leave this project "as is" and copy it to hd2
for further work, now that I have hardware issues sorted out.
