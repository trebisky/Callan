Callan CWC firmware

The CWC is the Callan Winchester Controller

I have a manual and schematic, so I decided to read out and
disassemble the ROMS, which are firmware for the 8x300 controller
on the board.  Lots of details and notes are in my comments
that are part of the disassembly listing.

A lot of things here are derived from my work on the AWSturbo
project.  The AWS Turbo was an 8x300 based hard drive controller
for an entirely different machine.
