/* ufs_read.c

 * Tom Trebisky  5-27-2022
 *
 * ufs_read - read/extract files from the Callan disk image.
 *
 * The Callan was an edition7 unix system running on a MC68010
 * The idea with this program is to read (extract) all the files
 * from this image, placing them into a directory in a modern
 * linux system.  There they can be studied, and the entire
 * collection can be gathered into a tar file so as to be
 * archived or shared with others.
 *
 * Some considerations up front:
 *
 * endian - the data on the disk is big endian.
 *  This of course should be preserved on the copied files,
 *  but pointers and such within the unix filesystem will
 *  need to be "fixed" within the program itself.
 *
 * special files - what do we do when we get to the /dev directory.
 *  We will cross that bridge when we get there.
 *  One possibility would be to generate a script/list that
 *  gets placed in the /dev directory for later study.
 *  We really don't need (or even want) the special files themselves.
 *
 * links - what do we do here?
 *  I intend to convert hard links to symbolic links.
 *  The way to do this is to keep an eye open for a link count
 *  that is not "1".  The first time it is encountered, just
 *  copy the file contents like any other, but add an entry to
 *  a table.  This table will be searched for all such subsequent
 *  encounters, and when it finds the contents already have been
 *  copied, it will make the symbolic link.  This means that the
 *  first link encountered will become the "hard name".
