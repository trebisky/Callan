link handling, table, symlinks
inode fix - make linear list of indirect blocks
  (used for both big dirs and file copy)
build file path during recursion x/y/z (use for links)
unlink - does dirent end or skip zero inode entries
duplicate filesystem -- mkdir, chdir, copy files
    - all owned by current user (tom)  ??
    - permissions and suid proper
Watch for blocks in bad zone.
